  <h4>What Simpson's Paradox is <em>not</em></h4>
  <p><strong>Simpson's:</strong> It was <a href="http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/2331677?uid=2&uid=4&sid=21102567680247">first mentioned</a> by British statistician <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Udny_Yule">Udny Yule</a> in 1903.</p>
  <p><strong>A paradox:</strong> Simpson's Paradox is just a special case of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omitted-variable_bias">ommitted variable bias</a>. W.V. Quine would call it a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox#Quine.27s_classification_of_paradoxes">vertical paradox</a>.</p>
  <p><strong>Every ommitted variable problem:</strong> Women earn only 77 percent of what men do, but according to Cornell economists <a href="http://digitalcommons.ilr.cornell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1248&context=ilrreview">Francine Blau and Lawrence Kahn</a>, accounting for work experience, education, industry, and unionization shrinks the gap to 91% (p. 52). So, discrimination matters less than the `77 percent` stat would lead you to believe. But is this Simpson's paradox? No, because the correction isn't large enough for the effect of gender to change sign.</p>
  <h4>Why Simpson's Paradox matters</h4>
  <p>Simpson's Paradox usually fools us on tests of performance. In a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson's_paradox#Kidney_stone_treatment">famous example</a>, researchers concluded that a newer treatment for kidney stones was more effective than traditional surgery, but it was <a href="http://www.bmj.com/content/309/6967/1480">later revealed</a> that the newer treatment was primarily being used on small kidney stones. As a more political example, <a href="http://iowahawk.typepad.com/iowahawk/2011/03/longhorns-17-badgers-1.html">on elementary school tests</a>, minority students in Texas outperform their peers in Wisconsin, but Texas has so many minority students that Wisconsin dominates it in state rankings.</p>
